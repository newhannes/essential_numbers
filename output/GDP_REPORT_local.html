            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> Real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter of 2024, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis's second estimate, equal to the 50 year average. Growth last quarter was 3.0 percent. GDP now amounts to $29.4 trillion in current dollars. With the gross national debt currently at $36.1 trillion, this debt-to-GDP ratio is 123%.</p>

            <h2>Contributors to GDP Growth</h2>
            <p> Of the 2.8 percent growth in real GDP, consumer spending was the largest contributor to growth, accounting for 56 percent of gross growth. Within consumer spending, services spending was the largest contributor, accounting for 29 percent of overall GDP growth. The second largest contributor was government spending and investment which accounted for 20 percent of total growth, with federal spending  driving the contribution of government spending and investment.  Exports accounted for 19 percent of total growth, with this growth primarily attributable to equipment exports. Private investment comprised 5 percent of total growth. Growth attributable to equipment and intellectual property products investment was partially offset by contractions in structures, residential, and inventory investment.  Imports, which are counted against GDP, dectracted 1.4 percentage points from GDP growth. </p>
